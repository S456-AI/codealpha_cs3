1. Code Review – Identifying Security Vulnerabilities

.A manual review of the Python login application revealed multiple security weaknesses. 
.The application stores user credentials directly in the source code and compares them with user input without applying security controls.
.This approach exposes sensitive information and increases the risk of unauthorized access.

2. Identified Security Vulnerabilities

.Passwords are stored in plain text, making them readable to anyone with access to the source code.
.User credentials are hardcoded within the application.
.No password hashing or encryption is used.
.Input validation is missing, allowing empty or invalid data.
.The authentication mechanism lacks protection against brute-force attempts.

3. Recommendations and Best Practices for Secure Coding

.Store passwords using secure hashing algorithms instead of plain text.
.Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in source code.
.Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
.Use secure authentication mechanisms and proper error handling.
.Follow established security standards such as OWASP Secure Coding Practices.

| Security Issue             | Impact                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Plaintext password storage | Exposure of sensitive data       |
| Hardcoded credentials      | Easy credential extraction       |
| No hashing mechanism       | High risk of password compromise |
| Missing input validation   | Input manipulation               |
| Weak authentication        | Unauthorized access              |

5. Remediation Steps for Safer Code

.Implement password hashing before storing or comparing credentials.
.Remove hardcoded credentials and store them securely.
.Add input validation to prevent invalid or empty inputs.
.Improve authentication logic to enhance overall application security.
